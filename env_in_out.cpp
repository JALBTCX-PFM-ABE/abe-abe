/****************************************  IMPORTANT NOTE  **********************************

    Comments in this file that start with / * ! or / / ! are being used by Doxygen to
    document the software.  Dashes in these comment blocks are used to create bullet lists.
    The lack of blank lines after a block of dash preceeded comments means that the next
    block of dash preceeded comments is a new, indented bullet list.  I've tried to keep the
    Doxygen formatting to a minimum but there are some other items (like <br> and <pre>)
    that need to be left alone.  If you see a comment that starts with / * ! or / / ! and
    there is something that looks a bit weird it is probably due to some arcane Doxygen
    syntax.  Be very careful modifying blocks of Doxygen comments.

#include "abe.hpp"


/*!
  These functions store and retrieve the program settings (environment) from a .ini file.  On both Linux and Windows
  the file will be called "misc->qsettings_app".ini (the name of the application with a .ini extension) and will be
  stored in a directory called ABE.config.  On Linux, the ABE.config directory will be stored in your $HOME directory.
  On Windows, it will be stored in your $USERPROFILE folder.  If you make a change to the way a variable is used and
  you want to force the defaults to be restored just change the settings_version to a newer number (I've been using
  the program version number from version.hpp - which you should be updating EVERY time you make a change to the
  program!).  You don't need to change the settings_version though unless you want to force the program to go back
  to the defaults (which can annoy your users).  So, the settings_version won't always match the program version.
